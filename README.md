# DattaQuantumTransportAtomToTransistor

This project aims to provide implementations of the exercises in the book "Quantum Transport: Atom to Transistor" by S. Datta (2005), using the C++ library [TBTK](https://github.com/dafer45/TBTK/) for second quantized models.
The project is meant to demonstrate the ease with which a wide range of quantum mechanical calculations can be performed using TBTK.
It also aims to be an entry point for students interested in quantum transport.
Aiding such students by providing an implementation that puts focus on higher level concepts rather than irrelevant numerical details.
